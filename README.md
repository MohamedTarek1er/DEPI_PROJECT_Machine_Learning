Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior and building a predictive system to identify whether a customer is likely to leave or not.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the key factors contributing to customer churn and develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts churn. The process includes extensive data preprocessing, in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), insightful visualizations, feature engineering, model building, and deployment.

Key Steps and Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized numerical data for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed detailed visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns related to customer churn.

Feature Engineering & Selection: Created new relevant features and selected the most impactful ones using various techniques to enhance model accuracy.

Model Training & Evaluation: Tried multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and others. Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to find the best-performing model.

Deployment: Built a functional deployment pipeline allowing users to input customer data and receive a prediction on whether the customer will churn.

Outcome
Successfully developed a robust churn prediction system with high accuracy and interpretability. This solution can help businesses take proactive actions to retain valuable customers.
